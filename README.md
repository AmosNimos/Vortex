## Philosophy and Vision
Amidst a landscape dominated by corporate giants, V0rtex emerges as a minimalist alternative to Chrome and Firefox. Rooted in the libre software movement, V0rtex prioritizes clarity, transparency, and deep customization. While its privacy features evolve, V0rtex empowers users with an accessible, comprehensible browser experience, distinct from Chrome-based norms. It stands for user choice and independence, offering a soulful alternative in today's tech sphere.

## Key Features

### Customizable GUI
- **Move GUI Elements**: Arrange and position toolbar buttons, URL bars, and other interface components to suit your workflow.
- **Theme Customization**: Easily change the color, text size, and style of the entire application.

### Web Page Customization

- **Rich Feature Set**: Despite its simplicity, V0rtex attempts to offer all the essential features you expect from a modern browser.

- **Portable and Lightweight**: The main V0rtex browser code is designed as a single file (excluding minimal library requirements), ensuring ease of distribution and setup.

- **Minimalism at its Core**: V0rtex embodies the philosophy of minimalism, offering a highly customizable browsing experience with minimal overhead. By maintaining a single-file core and minimal dependencies, V0rtex streamlines both user experience and development.

- **Following the Unix Philosophy**: V0rtex adheres to the Unix philosophy of doing one thing and doing it wellâ€”providing a reliable web browsing experience. This approach focuses on delivering efficiency and robust functionality without unnecessary complexity.

## Why Open Source?

V0rtex could have been just another closed-source project hidden in the shadows, but I chose to share it with the world! It had to be open source to truly fulfill its potential as one of the most hackable, modifiable, and customizable browsers available. By using Python, a beginner-friendly programming language, V0rtex becomes even more accessible and customizable.

Feel free to create your own branch or fork of this project. Just make sure to link back to the original repository and provide proper accreditation on the main page, both for recognition and license compliance.

Being open source allows V0rtex to be truly customizable. Users can modify the source code to add new features, fix bugs, or enhance existing functionality. Contributions from the community help to make V0rtex "THE" world's most customizable browser.

Sure, let's update the instructions to reflect the single-file nature of the project and include instructions for forking and contributing:

### Installation

To install V0rtex on your Linux system, follow these steps:

1. **Copy the source code:**
   Simply copy the entire content of the `v0rtex.py` file from the repository.

2. **Paste the code into a new file:**
   Create a new file on your system and paste the copied code into it. Save the file as `v0rtex.py`.

3. **Install the necessary dependencies:**
   Ensure you have Python installed. Then, install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install requests PyQt5
   ```

4. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   python v0rtex.py
   ```

### For Users Wanting to Customize the Source Code

The project will always have a release available for Linux. However, these steps are for users wanting to customize the source code, not just the compiled release. Keep in mind one of the principles of V0rtex is to keep the project as a single file so people can simply copy the code into their clipboard and paste it into an empty file to get the full project on their computer! As long as they have Python and the required libraries installed, they can run V0rtex. Therefore, you don't really have a reason to clone the whole repository unless you want to create a fork or contribute to the original project.

### Forking the Project

1. **Fork the repository on GitHub:**
   Go to the V0rtex repository on GitHub and click the "Fork" button in the upper-right corner of the page.

2. **Clone your fork:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/v0rtex.git
   ```

3. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd v0rtex
   ```

4. **Create a new branch for your changes:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b my-new-feature
   ```

5. **Make your changes and commit them:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add some feature"
   ```

6. **Push your changes to your fork:**
   ```bash
   git push origin my-new-feature
   ```

### Suggesting a Contribution

1. **Create a pull request:**
   After pushing your changes to your fork, go to the original V0rtex repository and create a new pull request. Be sure to describe your changes and why they should be merged.

2. **Wait for review:**
   The project maintainers will review your pull request and provide feedback or merge it into the main project.

> NOTE: The libraries are not included in the repository but can be installed using the `requirements.txt` file provided.

By following these instructions, you can easily customize and contribute to the V0rtex project, ensuring that it remains one of the most hackable and customizable browsers available.

### Configuration
V0rtex uses a configuration file located at `~/.config/v0rtex/v0rtex.conf`. This file allows you to set default settings such as the default URL, background color, foreground color, font size, and toggles for JavaScript, CSS, and cookies.

To ensure the configuration file and necessary directories are set up, run the following script:
```python
python setup_config.py
```

### Usage
